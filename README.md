# auto-renew
We got fed paying library money because they couldn't send a "gentle" reminder after the first fine. So here is a selenium-based automated
renewal application. 

## Windows users
1. Run the `install.bat` to install the program. 
2. Fill in your IIIT Delhi Library credentials on prompt.
3. Never worry about renewals ever again!
